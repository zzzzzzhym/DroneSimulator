# Neural-fly applied in python simulation 
This repo replicates Neural-Fly[1] project in a simulation environment. 

## Introduction
![system diagram](images/system_diagram.drawio.svg)

The repo is consisted with the following modules:  
- a drone dynamic simulation environment
- a drone controller based on [2]
- a trajectory generator based on [3]
- a replication of [4] 

## Demo
The simulation environment can produce the drone flight trace and its reference path.

The trajectory generator can produce a randomly sampled trajectory.
